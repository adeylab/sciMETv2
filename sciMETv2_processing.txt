1) unidex to generate demultiplexed reads as fastq files and filter to valid barcodes
2) trimmomatic on read 1 and read 2 separately
3) align to hybrid reference separately with read 1 using --pbat and read 2 as normal directional
4) name sort the bam files then merge reads 1 and 2
5) rmdup then observe complexity and run barnyard compare

6) filter asdapter-trimmed fastq files to only include individual species
7) repeat alignment, sorting, merging, and rmdup for species alignments
8a) on the pre-rmdup files, split to individual bam files then bam2mr for each cell then sort with 'sort -k 1,1 -k 2,2n -k 3,3n -k 6,6' merging both reads, then run preseq with -Q -e 5e+09 -s 1e+07
8b) run bismark methylaiton extractor with the --comprehensive option (combines strands)
9) run CHmeth2mtx.pl using windows and CGmeth2mtx.pl using annotated regions
10) run irlba using scitools on the ratio matrix for CH methylation
11) remove the first dimension (head -n1 then tail -n49 to same file)
12) run umap / matrix-pg / etc...
